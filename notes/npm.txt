use npm init for setting up pagage.json

use "npm install {name} --save" for installing and adding to pagage.json

use "npm install {name} --save-dev" for installing and adding to pagage.json, but only for development

use "npm install -g nodemon" for installing nodemon globally on computer

having automativ updating:
"moment": "2.14.1" = only this version
"moment": "~2.14.1" = only patches (.1)
"moment": "^2.14.1" = only patch and minor updates (.14.1)

"npm install" for installing
"npm update" for updating

Examples:
	npm install installs all modules that are listed on package.json file and their dependencies.
	npm update updates all packages in the node_modules directory and their dependencies.
	npm install express installs only the express module and its dependencies.
	npm update express updates the express module and its dependencies.

requiering from node_modules just using name like "require("moment");"

best pracsise is to run npm install on deplyment server instead of SFTP pushing all files in that folder from dev

use nodemon instead of node for "automatically restart when your code changes"
"npm install -g nodemon"
